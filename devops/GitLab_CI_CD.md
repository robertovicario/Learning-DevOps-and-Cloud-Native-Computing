# GitLab CI/CD

## Overview

GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform that combines the ability to develop, secure, and operate software in a single application. It is widely recognized for its integrated Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) capabilities, enabling automation in the phases of the software development lifecycle. GitLab supports both project management and version control tasks and integrates with various systems to facilitate continuous software delivery.

## CI/CD Server

The CI/CD server in GitLab is built-in and doesn't require separate installation. This server manages the processes defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files and executes jobs across multiple runners. GitLab CI/CD is used to create pipelines, which are configurations that define how software is delivered from code to production in stages.

## Runners

Runners are agents that execute the jobs defined in pipelines. They can be installed on separate machines, allowing for scaling the execution of jobs across multiple servers. Runners can be specific to a project or shared across multiple projects. They can be tagged to handle specific types of jobs, such as deployment or testing jobs.

## Stages

Stages in a pipeline are used to group jobs that run in the same phase of the CI/CD process. Common stages include build, test, and deploy. Stages are defined in the pipeline configuration and are executed in the order they are defined unless specifically configured to run in parallel.

## Jobs

Jobs are the most fundamental elements of a GitLab pipeline. Each job represents a set of instructions that should be executed by a runner. Jobs are assigned to stages and define what script to run. For example, a job can be set up to compile code, run tests, or deploy applications.

## Pipelines

Pipelines are the core components of GitLab’s CI/CD service. They define a series of jobs that get executed in stages or in a non-linear fashion depending on the requirements. Here’s a basic example of a GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration:

```yaml
stages:
    - build
    - test
    - deploy

build_job:
    stage: build
    script:
        - echo "Building the application..."
        - build_script

test_job:
    stage: test
    script:
        - echo "Running tests..."
        - test_script

deploy_job:
    stage: deploy
    script:
        - echo "Deploying to production..."
        - deploy_script
```

## Environments

Environments in GitLab CI/CD refer to the places where code is deployed. These can range from dynamic review apps to static staging and production environments. Environments help manage the transitions between different stages of the software delivery process.

## Predefined Variables

GitLab provides a set of predefined variables that can be used in any job in the pipeline. These include information about the job itself, the environment, and the project, such as `CI_COMMIT_SHA` or `CI_PROJECT_ID`.

## Project Variables

Project variables are defined by the users and can be configured in the GitLab UI under the CI/CD settings. They are often used to store sensitive information needed for the jobs, like deployment credentials.

## Container Registry

The GitLab Container Registry is an integrated Docker container registry that allows you to build, push, and pull images built from the GitLab CI. It is seamlessly integrated into GitLab projects and provides a secure way to store and access images needed for application deployment.

## Package Registry

Similar to the Container Registry, GitLab’s Package Registry allows users to build, publish, and share packages, such as npm or Maven packages, alongside their source code and CI/CD pipelines. It provides a private, secure space within a GitLab project to manage dependencies.
