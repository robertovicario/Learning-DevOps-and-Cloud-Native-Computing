# Spring Boot

## Overview

Spring Boot is an open-source, microservice-based Java framework that is used to create stand-alone, production-ready Spring-based applications. It simplifies the development and deployment process by providing defaults and auto-configuration. It minimizes the amount of boilerplate code and configuration needed to set up a Spring application.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a principle in which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. In Spring, this is achieved through the use of the IoC container which manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects.

### Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that implements IoC, allowing the creation of dependent objects outside of a class and providing those objects to a class in various ways. DI can be done through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.
