# Serverless

## Overview

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In this model, developers can focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

## FaaS (Function as a Service)

FaaS is a serverless computing model that allows developers to deploy individual functions that are triggered by specific events. These functions are stateless and ephemeral, with the cloud provider managing the execution environment, scaling, and availability.

Several tools support FaaS for multi-cloud environments:

- **AWS Lambda:** AWS Lambda is Amazon's FaaS offering, enabling developers to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway.

- **Azure Functions:** Azure Functions is Microsoft's serverless computing service that allows developers to execute code in response to events. It integrates with Azure services and third-party services through bindings and triggers.

- **Google Cloud Functions:** Google Cloud Functions is a lightweight, event-driven compute solution for Google Cloud that allows developers to run code in response to cloud events. It is tightly integrated with Google Cloud services and third-party services.
