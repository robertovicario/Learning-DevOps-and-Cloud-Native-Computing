# Multi-cloud

## Overview

Multi-cloud refers to the use of multiple cloud computing and storage services in a single heterogeneous architecture. This approach allows organizations to leverage the strengths of different cloud providers, avoid vendor lock-in, and optimize their cloud strategy for performance, cost, and compliance.

## Multi-cloud Computing

Multi-cloud computing involves deploying applications and services across multiple cloud environments. This can include a mix of public clouds (such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud), private clouds, and on-premises infrastructure.

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)

IaC provides a consistent way to manage and provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. By defining infrastructure in code, you can automate deployments, ensure consistency, and reduce errors.

Several tools support IaC for multi-cloud environments:

- **AWS CloudFormation:** Automates the setup and deployment of AWS resources using templates. It allows you to describe your infrastructure as code and manage it through AWS Management Console or APIs.

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):** Provides a unified management layer for Azure resources, allowing you to deploy, manage, and monitor resources using declarative templates.

- **Google Cloud Deployment Manager:** Enables you to create and manage Google Cloud resources using configuration files written in YAML or Python.

## Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. It codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

### Terraform CLI

The Terraform CLI is the primary tool for interacting with Terraform. It provides commands for managing your infrastructure, from initializing configurations to applying changes.

### Workflow

The typical Terraform workflow consists of several key steps to manage and apply infrastructure changes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown along with examples for each step:

1. **Write configuration:** Define the resources you need in a `.tf` file using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL):

```tf
provider "aws" {
region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
        Name = "example-instance"
    }
}
```

2. **Initialize the directory:** Run `terraform init` to initialize your configuration directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins.

3. **Format and validate configuration:** Use `terraform fmt` to format your configuration files and `terraform validate` to ensure the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent.

4. **Generate and review execution plan:** Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan. This step shows what actions Terraform will take to achieve the desired state.

5. **Apply changes:** Apply the changes required to reach the desired state using `terraform apply`. This command will prompt for confirmation before making any changes.

6. **Inspect state:** Check the current state of your infrastructure with `terraform show` or `terraform state` commands.

7. **Destroy infrastructure:** Use `terraform destroy` to remove all the infrastructure resources defined in your configuration.
